# Connect Four
## ⚠️ARCHIVED PROJECT

**This is an archived project from my bootcamp with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) in 2022-2023, kept for historical reference. It does not represent my current skill level or tech stack.**

This python terminal application is an arcade-style version of the classic game Connect Four, created as a project during my early learning phase.
