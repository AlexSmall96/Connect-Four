# Connect Four
## ⚠️ARCHIVED PROJECT

**This is an archived project from my bootcamp with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) in 2023, kept for historical reference. It does not represent my current skill level or tech stack.**

This python terminal application is an arcade-style version of the classic game Connect Four.

The game has a classic arcade feel to it, which fits well within the limits of a python terminal application. The application prints a board and counters to the terminal to illustrate the game and is updated through user input. The game can be played as a two-player game, with both players operating the same device, or as a one-player game, with the user playing against the computer. The computer choice is mostly random, but the computer has some intelligence programmed in as it blocks streaks of 4 being played by the user and can detect when it is about to win. The user(s) can select their usernames, and the game is replayable, giving the user a customized, complete experience.

)  Python Essentials Module, along with some external resources:

- The code used to color the o's in the title was taken from the following article on [stackabuse](https://stackabuse.com/how-to-print-colored-text-in-python/).

- The symbols used to create the title, board and counters were inspired by [alt-codes.net](https://www.alt-codes.net).

- The code used to clear the last line of the terminal when 'Computer is thinking message ...' displays was taken from the following forum [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44565704/how-to-clear-only-last-one-line-in-python-output-console).

All external resources are commented on in the code at the relevant places.
